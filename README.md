Fire Materials Database

*A suite of tools and data in support of predictive fire modeling.*

The Fire Materials Database (FMD) is being developed to help computational fire modelers find input parameters to describe the pyrolysis of a broad range of flammable materials. There are essentially two types of elements to the FMD:
1. Data from milligram-scale and bench-scale tests such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), or cone calorimetry; and
2. Tools for calibrating material properties used in pyrolysis models.
